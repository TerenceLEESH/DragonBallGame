# DragonBallGame
It is a simple game that a character will move with clicking the monitor.

What I learned:
1. How to place the items(i.e. Button, Label) properly.
2. How to connect Model, View and Controller for the application.
3. How to insert Image, Audio in the application.
4. How to create some simple interactions in the application
   (i.e clicking to stop or start the character)
